                        We give you the opportunity to exchange Skins for firiCSGO virtual currency, “Coins”. 
                        Coins are not real money, do not have monetary value, and may never be redeemed for
                        “real world” money, or other items of monetary value from outside of the Service without
                        our written permission. While we may use terms like “buy”, “purchase” or “sell” in reference
                        to Coins, we do so only for convenience and such terms in no way indicate that Coins have monetary 
                        value or are real money. You acknowledge that Coins are not real currency and are not redeemable 
                        for any sum of money from us at any time. We make no guarantee as to the nature, quality or value of 
                        the features of the Service or any third-party goods or services that will be accessible through

                    <h5> WITHDRAW SKINS </h5>
                    <p>
                        Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Skins may be deposited on firiCSGO in exchange for Coins. Depositing Skins on firiCSGO implies that you fully accept firiCSGO Skin valuation prices and understand that you will not receive a refund in the case of a Skin price being lower than the market value.
                        You can redeem Coins for Skins from the Withdraw Page by selecting the skins you wish to withdraw and hitting “Withdraw”. A Trade Offer from one or more of our firiCSGO bots will be sent to your Steam account. Your selected Skins will be sent to the Steam trade URL linked to your firiCSGO account. We do not guarantee the items received by you to be identical to those from the Withdraw Page.
                        Open trade offers will be automatically cancelled by firiCSGO if they are not accepted thirty minutes after opening by a firiCSGO bot. If a trade offer is canceled by a firiCSGO bot, we will return Coins into your firiCSGO account. We are not responsible for the name tags or stickers attached to your Skins. firiCSGO is not responsible for the loss of your Skins as a result of any third-parties including Steam.
                        Using firiCSGO as a trading platform is prohibited. Users found doing this will be blocked from withdrawing and may have other restrictions put in place. We define trading as using our service to deposit items with the intention of withdrawing other items for a profit without a proportionate amount of play.
