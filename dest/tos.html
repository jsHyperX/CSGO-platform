                <p>
                    By using CSGORoll.com (henceforth to be referred to as “CSGORoll”), you acknowledge and accept these Terms of Service in full and without reservation, you are agreeing to our Terms of Service and you are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws. These Terms of Service govern your use of this website.
                    CSGORoll reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms of Service, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Service (including without limitation, the availability of any feature, database, or content) at any time by posting a notice on the Site or by sending you notice through the Service or via email.
                    CSGORoll may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability. It is your responsibility to check these Terms of Service periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Service following the posting of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes.
                    You must be at least 18 years of age to play on CSGORoll.

                <h2> OWNERSHIP </h2>
                <p>
                    All materials on this website are intellectual property of CSGORoll and you may not use any of the content seen here for commercial use without permission. Exclusive rights for Counter Strike: Global Offensive and

                </p>
                <h3> COINS </h3>
                <p>
                    We give you the opportunity to exchange Skins for CSGORoll virtual currency, “Coins”. 
                    Coins are not real money, do not have monetary value, and may never be redeemed for
                    “real world” money, or other items of monetary value from outside of the Service without
                    our written permission. While we may use terms like “buy”, “purchase” or “sell” in reference
                    to Coins, we do so only for convenience and such terms in no way indicate that Coins have monetary 
                    value or are real money. You acknowledge that Coins are not real currency and are not redeemable 
                    for any sum of money from us at any time. We make no guarantee as to the nature, quality or value of 
                    the features of the Service or any third-party goods or services that will be accessible through 
                    the use of Coins.
                </p>
                <h4> WITHDRAW SKINS </h4>
                <p>
                    Counter-Strike: Global Offensive Skins may be deposited on CSGORoll in exchange for Coins. Depositing Skins on CSGORoll implies that you fully accept CSGORoll Skin valuation prices and understand that you will not receive a refund in the case of a Skin price being lower than the market value.
                    You can redeem Coins for Skins from the Withdraw Page by selecting the skins you wish to withdraw and hitting “Withdraw”. A Trade Offer from one or more of our CSGORoll bots will be sent to your Steam account. Your selected Skins will be sent to the Steam trade URL linked to your CSGORoll account. We do not guarantee the items received by you to be identical to those from the Withdraw Page.
                    Open trade offers will be automatically cancelled by CSGORoll if they are not accepted thirty minutes after opening by a CSGORoll bot. If a trade offer is canceled by a CSGORoll bot, we will return Coins into your CSGORoll account. We are not responsible for the name tags or stickers attached to your Skins. CSGORoll is not responsible for the loss of your Skins as a result of any third-parties including Steam.
                    Using CSGORoll as a trading platform is prohibited. Users found doing this will be blocked from withdrawing and may have other restrictions put in place. We define trading as using our service to deposit items with the intention of withdrawing other items for a profit without a proportionate amount of play.
